-1- INTRODUCTION
q3cpmahudeditor is an editor for the superHUD implementation by CPMA [1] 
for the fps quake3.


-2- USING Q3CPMAHUDEDITOR
You either can start from scratch by creating your hud or you open an
existing one and modify it (recommended). The cpma huds are placed in 
<quake3dir>/cpma/hud/
Make sure you save it to that directory. Otherwise you cannot use
them ingame.

To tell cpma which hudfile you want to use set the cvar ch_file to
the name of the hud (without the extension .cfg).
For example if you want to use hud3.cfg, put in 
<quake3dir>/cpma/autoexec.cfg: seta ch_file hud3

The gui should be more or less self explanatory, here a few hints:


Main Frame:
That's where the hud "preview" is drawn.
* There are (currently) three renderer available. OpenGL > Native,
  Textrenderer displays preview of hudfile in text format.
* You can drag&drop items around, they snap to eachother. You can 
  disable it by unchecking 'Tools->Snap to neighbour items' in the
  menu (or pressing Alt+S). Items also snap to the screen boundary. 
  (Dragging and snapping thresholds can be changed in the 
  preferences)
* While dragging the element around you can click on right mousebutton
  to abort.
* You may also move the selected item with keys. left/right/up/down
  arrow moves them with bigger step around whereas if you press SHIFT
  during the moving they only take a small step. (Step widths can be
  set in preferences, default is 10px and 1px.)
* Resizing with arrow keys can be done while having the ALT key
  pressed.
* Check out 'Tools->Draw helpers' to quickly toggle the visual hints.
* Keep Ctrl pressed while draggin an element around and it sticks to
  the x/y-axis' where you started dragging.


Properties Dialog:
* The checkboxes on the very left have the purpose to override the
  property which otherwise is inherited from !DEFAULT (or any other
  item that can be inherited from, currently only !DEFAULT).
* [ ] Enable: does enable this item. Mostly this means the item will
  be written to the hudfile and also is visible on the hud. If it's
  not enabled it isn't drawn in q3cpmahudeditor as well as not in
  cpma. Certain items cannot be disabled. For example specialitems
  like !DEFAULT but you can remove and insert them by rightclicking
  on them in the elements dialog.
  Other items cannot be disabled because the superHUD documentation
  states: even if they aren't specified in the hudfile they are drawn!
  So you must place them offscreen or set opaqueness to 0%.
  (Read the description at the bottom. It is noted in there if this is
  the case)
* Foreground, Special: The foreground can have special colors like T
  for your teamcolor or E for the enemy color.
  Also check the description of the items (e.g. Score_NME/OWN and
  FlagStatus_NME/OWN)
* Description: Of each item is on the very bottom of the dialog.
  Contains useful information. (mostly copied from the promode
  wiki [2])

Hud elements Dialog:
* The ordering of the items in there will be the exact same in the
  written hudfile. Only enabled items (green icon) will be written
  though.
* Rightclick on item: Displays item menu.
* Button, Left: Displays item menu.
* Button, Center: Moves the selected item one position up.
* Button, Right: Moves the selected item one position down.
* Doublick on item: toggles enable.
* Item menu: You may insert or remove items which aren't unique
  like !DEFAULT.
* Copy&Paste: You can copy an item's properties to others. 
  `Paste w/o position' means we paste everything except the position.
* Elements can be reordered with drag&drop.

  
-3- CONFIG FILE
Will be automatically created at

(Windows) 
    C:\Documents and Settings\<username>\Application Data\q3cpmahudeditor\q3cpmahudeditor.conf
(Linux)   
  ~/.q3cpmahudeditor/q3cpmahudeditor.conf


-4- IMAGES/FONTS FROM PK3 FILES
In hud elements you may also specify which image to draw as background.
Those are taken from the pk3s the game provides which are normally not
subject to change but restricted which ones you can use. That restriction
depends on the server you are on, you can only pick images from pk3s the
server has.
Hence you should (normally) stick to those images that are in pk3s which are
on _all_ servers. The default value for which pk3s we are looking in, specifies
those should-have paks. (main pak, pointrelease pak, cpma pak, cpm-maps pak)
  
If you want to change it, feel free to do so ('Tools->Preferences, Expert').

For q3cpmahudeditor to load files from the pk3s it must know where to find
them. If you don't have a q3 installation you can still fake it by creating
the following subdirs in a folder where you point q3cpmahudeditor at if it 
asks for a quake3 installation directory: baseq3/ and cpma/

Of course this will lead to missing pk3s (images, fonts). The fonts can
solely be found in the cpma/z-cpma-pakXXX.pk3 though (you can get this from the 
official cpma release [1], XXX = version)


-5- SUPERHUD
A (mostly) complete documentation about superHUD files can be found
at the cpma wiki [2].


-6- BUGS
Known bugs can be found in the file KNOWNISSUES
Limitations of superHUD itself can be read at [3].
