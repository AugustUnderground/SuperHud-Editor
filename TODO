! [wxMSW] selected items in elementslist have no collicon
% if an argument to a property read from hudfile is invalid, be consistent: either ignore or use default (but always the same)
! backspace not working in pakfilebrowser on wxgtk (what about wxmsw?)
+ add preferences for `view_updatewhiledragging'


-- later maybe --
+ maybe blink/flash/fade those items that have a `time' (duration) set? :)
+ add 5:4 resolution Oo
+ create statusbar reset function that sets to `Ready'.. cba right now..
+ [linux] make APPRELATIVE and APPPAK also look in ~/.superhudeditor/
+ snapping outside of hudview (black borders) is b0rked i think
+ read proxy in webupdater from superhudeditor.conf
+ figure out (or rather: confirm?) onwhich elements `color T/E' changes something
+ add presets (in particular: oldschool-flagstatus, oldschool-score, ch_teamBackground hack, chat/team messages)
+ add prefs, always use correct hud path in filedialogs (aka quake3/cpma/hud/)
+ autosave every X mins
+ undo/redo ffs
+ add preferences to specify datadir (in case someone wants to overwrite it) (orly?)
t the global defined messages (common.h) are they translated?
+ translate to other languages
+ backspace key should reset item @ elementlist
+ delete key should remove item @ elementlist
+ make use of scrollwheel?
+ cpma/docs/README.hudspecs - for colorTE and FILL there is a border (which texture?) drawn. (TODO all elements?)
+ if ICON and draw3d we could lay a texture over it like modeltexture but without the backgroundmodel..
+ add an accelerator to temporarily hide all other elements except selected
+ [linux] docs not installed?! they are with ebuild on gentoo though
