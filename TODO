? toolbar file view is not properly updated with menu item (->debug win)
+ add second background image for 16:10
? E_T_ICON and color with alpha, check if correctly rendered (->PowerUp3_Icon e.g.) looks like alpha is ignored @she
+ dragging is too slow

[UNIX] make APPRELATIVE and APPPAK also look in ~/.superhudeditor/


-- later --
+ snapping outside of hudview (black borders) is b0rked
+ read proxy in webupdater from superhudeditor.conf
+ figure out (or rather: confirm?) onwhich elements `color T/E' changes something
+ add presets (in particular: oldschool-flagstatus, oldschool-score, ch_teamBackground hack, chat/team messages)
+ add prefs, always use correct hud path in filedialogs (aka quake3/cpma/hud/)
+ autosave every X mins
+ undo/redo ffs
+ add preferences to specify datadir (in case someone wants to overwrite it) (orly?)
% move the enable/disable element buttons to the ElementsCtrlBase panel (orly?)
t the global defined messages (common.h) are they translated?
+ translate to other languages
+ backspace key should reset item @ elementlist
+ delete key should remove item @ elementlist
+ make use of scrollwheel?
+ cpma/docs/README.hudspecs - for colorTE and FILL there is a border (which texture?) drawn. (TODO all elements?)
+ if ICON and draw3d we could lay a texture over it like modeltexture but without the backgroundmodel..
+ add an accelerator to temporarily hide all other elements except selected
? there is some fishy code with Colour4/wxColour conversion to not loose precision...
