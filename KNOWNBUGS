--- Application ---
* the webupdater does not support a proxy (you should go to the website and download it yourself)

--- SuperHud Implementation ---
* [SuperHud] for certain elements of type ICON (game gives us an image) $color is ignored in CPMA.
  ignoring: ItemPickupIcon, StatusBar_AmmoIcon in particular
  Not ignored: AttackerIcon
  but we apply the color to all of those

--- wxWidgets ---
* if a pane is detached the caption does not update (wxAui bug?)
* [wxGTK-2.8.7.1] - a corrupted zipfile reports to contain any file so we won't look any further and load rubbish (wxFileSystem::FindFileInPath returns falsely true)
* [wxGTK-2.8.7.1] wxPropGrid, if a row is selected, text cannot be read (white on white?)
