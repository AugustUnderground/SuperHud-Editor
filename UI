User Interface Design Conventions


Element properties:

- properties can be in groups, e.g. the position&size all belong to a single script
  command named `rect'. So if a user overwrites the position he automatically overwrites
  the size as well.
- Properties that are being inherited are colored differently and contain the value they 
  inherit (either from a parent (!DEFAULT) or by the game's default values)
- if a user changes a colored property the whole property group is copied from the
  parent and the newly modified value set. (i.e. he inherits the values but the own
  change is applied and from now on that element overwrites that propertygroup)
- if a user clicks the checkbox the parental values aren't copied but the element's
  values are taken (which probably are either default or those that have been set
  previously while the property was set to be overwritten)
